                Automation is becoming more and more pervasive in society. One of the most anticipated, and feared, forms of automation is the automated vehicle.
                Several different car companies have been working on making self driving cars safe, and several sates have made laws enabling these companies to 
                do their research and testing on our streets. But there have been a few accidents and critics poiint to these as evidence that self driving cars are not viable, 
                but those accidents have been rare and have been a result of human error in every case except one.

                Other difficulties people have with the technology are fear of change and simply the joy of driving. People don't want to lose the ability to drive just pleasure. 
                Another issue is ethics. Given the choice, should an autonomous car strike pedestrians or risk killing its own passengers? Do people want to be in a car 
                where that decision has been taken from them?
