                Machine language is the lowest level language that the computer uses. It is writtten in binary code, 
                which is a numbering system that uses only ones and zeroes. It can be described as 2<sup>N</sup> where N = the digit,
                and is referred to as a base<sub>2</sub> system.

                Is binary the most efficient number system? No. So why do we use it for computers? We use it because compters run on electricity, 
                and switches can be on or off, so a number system with only two digits works best for this.

                Hexadecimal is used for memory locations and for color codes. It is a base<sub>16</sub> number system. 
                Hexadecimal numbers are recognised as such because they are usually preceded by an 0x prefix.
                Hexadecimal has 16 digits, 0-9 plus the letters A-F to represent the digits 0-15.
                
                0 = 0<br> 1 = 1<br> 2 = 2<br> 3 = 3<br> 4 = 4<br> 5 = 5<br> 6 = 6<br> 7 = 7<br> 8 = 8<br> 9 = 9<br> A = 10<br> B = 11<br> C  = 12<br> D = 13<br> E = 14<br> F = 15<br>

                <p>
                    There are other systems, such as octal, or base<sub>8</sub>, and duodecimal, or base <sub>12</sub>. 
                    Both of the systems are considered to be better than our common decimal system, but people probably began using decimal 
                    because humans have ten fingers, and at this point, decimal is so ingrained in our society and instituions, that it is unlikely that will ever change.
